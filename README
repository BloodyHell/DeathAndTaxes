You start with a village (later this can be a world with multiple villages but for now let's start with a village).

This village has two types of buildings: Agriculture and production.

Agriculture: Produces crude base goods like crops, animals, wood and minerals
Production: Takes the crude goods that Agriculture produces and transforms them into products.


How to determine which agriculture and production buildings are generated in a village?

a) Set a baseline of population that is needed before a village can get a specific building
    1) If the baseline of populace is reached, give each "tick" a change to build the building
        I) Only if no other buildings are being built at that moment
    2) Each building has a building time, and is not used before the building is build
    3) Randomly select which building is built
        I) If possible from a config file containing a list of buildings

b) Based on the surroundings
    !) Must implement the world and random resource generation, too much for now



Glossary:

"Tick": A tick is a not yet determined period of time.
